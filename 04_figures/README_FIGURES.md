# Figures Directory

This directory will contain figures for the paper "Before the Command Was Spoken."

## Planned Figures

### Figure 1: Four-Phase Evolutionary Model
Temporal evolution of enforcement mechanisms from Ancestral Pan-Homo (~6 Ma) to Present, showing:
- Phase 1: Partner choice only
- Phase 2: TPP emergence (Pleistocene)
- Phase 3: RDH functional (Paleolithic 35-10 ka)
- Phase 4: Hierarchy institutionalized (Neolithic-Present)

### Figure 2: Cross-Species Enforcement Mechanisms
Comparative table showing TPP, inequity punishment, partner choice, and primary mechanisms across Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, Cebus apella, and Homo sapiens.

### Figure 3: Temporal Pattern of Exclusionary Burials
Graph showing 0.67% (Paleolithic) → 27% (Chalcolithic) exclusion with statistical significance markers (χ²=11.89, p<0.001).

### Figure 4: Extended Phenotype Theory Validation
Diagram showing 5/5 predictions confirmed across constitutional law, fiscal policy, mortuary practices, ritual transmission, and primate cooperation.
