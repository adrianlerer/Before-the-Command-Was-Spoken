## Overview

This repository contains replication materials for **two companion papers** on the evolutionary foundations of law by Ignacio Adrián Lerer:

### Paper 1: Before the Command Was Spoken
**Subtitle**: *Law as the Extended Phenotype of Pre-Linguistic Norms*

**Core Thesis**: Law is not a human invention *ex nihilo*, but the extended phenotype of pre-linguistic normative patterns that evolved to stabilize cooperation in early human groups.

**Status**: Completed. SSRN Working Paper [Add link when available]

**Target Audience**: Evolutionary biologists, anthropologists, archaeologists, legal theorists

---

### Paper 2: Resolving Kelsen's Paradox
**Subtitle**: *How Evolutionary Biology Explains the Grundnorm*

**Core Thesis**: Hans Kelsen's "presupposed" Grundnorm (basic norm) is not a transcendental presupposition but an evolutionarily inherited predisposition for norm-following. Converging evidence from primatology, archaeology, developmental psychology, and neuroscience shows normative cognition predates linguistic articulation by millions of years.

**Status**: Complete outline (90KB, 80-85 pages planned). Literature review phase.

**Target Journals**: *Philosophy & Public Affairs*, *Legal Theory* (Cambridge), *Oxford Journal of Legal Studies*

**Target Audience**: Legal philosophers, Kelsen scholars, analytical jurisprudence community

## Key Findings

### Primatology
- **0% third-party punishment** in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes, N=46)
  - Ultimatum game: 5-14% rejection (vs. 50% in humans)
  - Kinship effect: χ²(1)=0.15, p=0.70 (no effect)
- **Bonobo female coalitions**: 85% directed against males (β=0.762, p<0.001)
- **Capuchin inequity punishment**: 25.7% frequency but intention-blind

### Archaeology
- **Upper Paleolithic** (35-10 ka BP): 0.67% exclusionary burials (1/150)
- **Neolithic/Chalcolithic** (10-3 ka BP): 9-27% exclusionary burials (353/3,752)
- **Statistical significance**: χ²(1)=11.89, p<0.001
- **Gini coefficient doubling**: 0.32 → 0.64 (Paleolithic → Neolithic)

### Sunghir Case (Anti-Exclusion)
- Children with severe disabilities received **most elaborate burials**
- >7,500 person-hours investment (≈4 years full-time work)
- 10,000+ grave goods (ivory beads, mammoth spears)

## Theoretical Framework

**Extended Phenotype Theory (EPT)** applied to law:
- **Paper 1 contribution**: Demonstrates proto-norms predated prescriptive language using four evidence streams
- **Paper 2 contribution**: Resolves Hans Kelsen's Grundnorm paradox by showing the "presupposed" basic norm is actually an evolutionarily inherited predisposition

### Key Mechanisms
- Proto-norms enforced through partner choice, coalitions, punishment
- Deontic modality (must, may, should) universal across languages—emerged to scale cooperation beyond Dunbar's number (~150)
- Legal institutions are extended phenotypes of competing memeplexes
- Normative "ought-feeling" has phylogenetically ancient neural basis (vmPFC, anterior insula)

### Validated Anomalies (Paper 1)
EPT explains 3 previously unexplained patterns:
  1. 19th Amendment functional extinction (93.3% citation collapse)
  2. Argentina's 93-year fiscal lock-in without constitutional authorization
  3. International law multi-arena forum shopping (73.3% of cases)

### Resolved Paradoxes (Paper 2)
EPT resolves Kelsen's 80-year-old problem:
  - **Kelsen's claim**: Grundnorm is presupposed as transcendental condition for legal cognition
  - **Our resolution**: Grundnorm is evolutionarily inherited predisposition, not presupposition
  - **Evidence**: Normativity predates language by millions of years (phylogeny) and years (ontogeny)

## Testable Predictions

1. **Deontic Density → Enforcement Complexity** (ρ>0.50, p<0.01 expected)
2. **Ritual Frequency → Norm Persistence** (χ² test, p<0.05 expected)
3. **Neural Overlap** (Ritual/Law Processing): ≥60% overlap in ACC+TPJ expected
