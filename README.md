## Abstract

This repository contains replication materials for the paper "Before the Command Was Spoken: Law as the Extended Phenotype of Pre-Linguistic Norms" by Ignacio Adrián Lerer.

**Core Thesis**: Law is not a human invention *ex nihilo*, but the extended phenotype of pre-linguistic normative patterns that evolved to stabilize cooperation in early human groups.

## Key Findings

### Primatology
- **0% third-party punishment** in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes, N=46)
  - Ultimatum game: 5-14% rejection (vs. 50% in humans)
  - Kinship effect: χ²(1)=0.15, p=0.70 (no effect)
- **Bonobo female coalitions**: 85% directed against males (β=0.762, p<0.001)
- **Capuchin inequity punishment**: 25.7% frequency but intention-blind

### Archaeology
- **Upper Paleolithic** (35-10 ka BP): 0.67% exclusionary burials (1/150)
- **Neolithic/Chalcolithic** (10-3 ka BP): 9-27% exclusionary burials (353/3,752)
- **Statistical significance**: χ²(1)=11.89, p<0.001
- **Gini coefficient doubling**: 0.32 → 0.64 (Paleolithic → Neolithic)

### Sunghir Case (Anti-Exclusion)
- Children with severe disabilities received **most elaborate burials**
- >7,500 person-hours investment (≈4 years full-time work)
- 10,000+ grave goods (ivory beads, mammoth spears)

## Theoretical Framework

**Extended Phenotype Theory (EPT)** applied to law:
- Proto-norms predated prescriptive language
- Deontic modality (must, may, should) universal in all natural languages
- Legal institutions are extended phenotypes of competing memeplexes
- Validates 3 previously unexplained anomalies:
  1. 19th Amendment functional extinction (93.3% citation collapse)
  2. Argentina's 93-year fiscal lock-in without constitutional authorization
  3. International law multi-arena forum shopping (73.3% of cases)

---

## Testable Predictions

1. **Deontic Density → Enforcement Complexity** (ρ>0.50, p<0.01 expected)
2. **Ritual Frequency → Norm Persistence** (χ² test, p<0.05 expected)
3. **Neural Overlap** (Ritual/Law Processing): ≥60% overlap in ACC+TPJ expected
